> Inspired by common IS frameworks (e.g., Laudon & Laudon, *Management Information Systems*).

#### Steps in the Model
1. **Business Challenge** — Competition, new technology, or market shifts.
2. **Strategic Planning & Collaboration** —  
   - *Management:* Defines strategy and selects technology.  
   - *Organization:* Updates processes and roles.  
   - *Technology:* Provides tools and infrastructure.
3. **Information System Lifecycle** — Build → Test → Deploy.
4. **Business Impact** — Increased sales, better service, and improved operations.
