# Lecture Notes: 1. Information Systems Are Essential

**Introduction:** 
Many businesses have evolved into digital firms to become more competitive and efficient. 

**Key Points:** 
- Past management of Information (Zhang, 2013; Gleick, 2011; News, 2025; Ly-Huong T. Pham & Tejal Desai-Naik, 2023)
	- Early businesses used Manual systems to process information. Information in whole has evolved over the years. 
		- Manual Systems and Early Processing
		- Mechanical Devices and Early Computing
		- Communication Technologies

- MIS Top 5 Changes (Laudon & Laudon, 2023, p.6-7)
	- These are the top 5 "paramount" importances discussed in the textbook by Laudon & Laudon (2023).
		- Changes in Firms and Organizations (Wynn & Felser, 2023)
		- Management Changes (Wynn & Felser, 2023)

		- challenges
		- opportunities 

- Going Digital Fully (Al-Samawi, 2019)
	- Many companies are fully online with their services and products, and often do not have a building.
		- What does that mean?
		- How is it done?

- Strategic Objectives of Business Processes (Laudon & Laudon, 2023, p.11)
	- For companies to stay successful and competitive, they need to have strategic objectives for business processes.

- How do you use Information Systems on the daily discussion post?

**Summary:** 
This section gives a preview into information systems, by giving a snapshot of how people interacted with information before Information Systems, how people interact with information now, and where information systems might be going. It talks about MIS Top 5 "paramount" importances (Laudon & Laudon, 2023), including changes in firms and Organizations, Management changes, IT Innovations, New Business models, and the growth of e-commerce. These are areas where information systems are immersed. The section also talks about companies that decided to go global, what challenges they faced, and what opportunities were open for them. Not all companies were able to become global (i.e., Starbucks). Many companies became or started out as fully digital, where all operations are done online and often remotely. Lastly, the section ends with a look at the Strategic Objectives of business processes, taking a look at what makes a business strategic, including operational excellence, new products, services, and business models, customer and supplier intimacy, improved decision making, competitive advantage, and survival. As a preview, you sort of get pushed into the deep end and asked to swim; you have to rely on your own experiences to make sense of all the information here.

Notes:
Rough version of the Common IS framework
The company has a challenge (new technology and competition) --> 
Everyone works together (Management - strategy and select technology, Organization - revise functions and processes, Technology - devices) --> 
Information System (made, tested, used) --> 
company solution (growth in sales, service, and operations)
